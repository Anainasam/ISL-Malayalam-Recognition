## 🚀 For Your Teammates

### Quick Start (1 minute setup):
```bash
# 1. Copy the production_model folder to their system
# 2. Setup environment
cd production_model
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Test setup
python setup_check.py

# 4. See system in action
python demo.py
```

### Basic Usage:
```python
from src.isl_recognizer import ISLMalayalamRecognizer

# Initialize (loads 86.8% accuracy model)
recognizer = ISLMalayalamRecognizer()

# Recognize ISL sign from video
word, malayalam, confidence = recognizer.recognize_sign("video.mp4")
print(f"Recognized: {word} → {malayalam} (confidence: {confidence:.1%})")
```
